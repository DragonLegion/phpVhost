PHP based Vhost project for IRC networks.

This is a CLI script and NOT designed to be run as a webserver page but WILL have both plaintext and XML/HTML based logging.

File open based and socket based forks will be developed.

Coding style is based on C++ coding standards.

All functions are to be explained either in a .function file or a code block header before the function.
